# Python-introduction
* python is all about readability. so 4 x whitespaces are the standard.

## Python Installation
* it's already installed to check the version type: python3 --version 
* or: python --version

### terminal inline coding
* to test some code in the terminal type: python3
* to exit type: ctrl+D
* python doesn't really use {} to show end of functions it uses blank spaces. spacing is super inportant. 
* a for loop looks like this:
* for i in range(5):
* (4 x spacebar)     x = i * 10
* (4 x spacebar)     print(x)
* an extra empty line shows that the function / code block is complete
* need help on a module? type: help(module_name)
* to exit help type: Q
#### Import modules in terminal
* import modules: import module_name
* it import specific function from a module: from module_name import function_name
* example: from math inport factoral
* to rename a function during import: from math import factorial as fac

#### If else statements
* h=42
* if h>50:
*    print("yes")
* else:
*    print("no)
* else if is writen: elif
