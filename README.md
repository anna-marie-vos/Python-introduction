### terminal inline coding
* to run a python file in the terminall type: python fileName.py
* to test some code in the terminal type: python3
* to exit type: ctrl+D
* python doesn't really use {} to show end of functions it uses blank spaces. spacing is super inportant.
* a for loop looks like this:
* for i in range(5):
* (4 x spacebar)     x = i * 10
* (4 x spacebar)     print(x)
* an extra empty line shows that the function / code block is complete
* need help on a module? type: help(module_name)
* to exit help type: Q
#### Import modules in terminal
* import modules: import module_name
* it import specific function from a module: from module_name import function_name
* example: from math inport factoral
